# MC-Ratio-96-wells
ImageJ macro for analyzing fluorescence data obtained in 96 wells plates
blabla
## Requirements
Runs on 2019 FIJI and ImageJ 
The macros were tested on MacOS Mojave (10.14.5) running:
ImageJ v1.52p with Java 1.8.0_101 (64-bit) and on Fiji Version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52p.

The macros were tested also on Windows 10 (version 1803 for x64-based systems) running:
ImageJ v1.52p with Java 1.8.0_112 (64-bit) and on Fiji version 1.52p running with Java 1.8.0 172 (64-bit)

BioFormats v.6.1.1 or v 6.1.0 (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/) must be installed in ImageJ. In Fiji this is installed automatically.

For usage see main manuscript Secondary screen - Cellular brightness in mammalian cells.

## Usage
ImageJ & FIJI macro's can be dragged and droppped on the toolbar, which opens the editor from which the macros can be started.
Macros can also be loaded via Plugins->Macros menu, either use Edit or Run.

## Test data
Test can be downloaded from following zenodo repository : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3338150
